This paper has provided some interesting method and finding.

First, it has used a 3-parameter model to simulation stream DOC. These three parameters are (i) a basin-specific DOC release parameter “_k_<sub>DOC</sub><sup>”</sup>, related to the wet- and open-water area percentages per basin, (ii) the lag time “_τ_” between DOC production and subsequent stream DOC emergence, related to the catchment area above the stream sampling location; and (iii) the activation energy “Ea”, to deal with the temperature effect on DOC production.

Second, it also revealed that other factors may play an important role as well.
