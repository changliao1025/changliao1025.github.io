A list of variables has been established to describe the ecosystem system state. Specially, these variables are from different process-based algorithms.

| Module | Variable | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Radiation | Shortwave | Incoming shortwave radiation |
| | PAR | Photosynthetically active radiation |
| Evapotranspiration | Potential ET | Total potential evapotranspiration |
| Interception | canopy depth | Depth of rain and snow in canopy |
|
| |
| | canopy ET | ET from the canopy |
|
| |
| | Net rain | Net rain from canopy |
| | Net snow | Net snow from canopy |
| Snow | SCA | Snow cover area |
| | Snow albedo | Snow albedo |
| | Snow ET | Snow sublimation |
| | Snowmelt | |
| | SWE | Snowpack water equivalent |
| | SWE temperature | Temperature of the snowpack |
| Infiltration | Infiltration | |
| Surface runoff | Surface runoff | |
| | Surface runoff upslope | Surface runoff from upslope |
| Soil | Dunnian runoff | |
| | Dunnian runoff upslope | |
| | Interflow | |
| | Interflow upslope | |
| | Soil moisture | |
| | Soil to groundwater | |
| Groundwater | Groundwater inflow | |
| | Groundwater outflow | |
| | Groundwater upslope | |
