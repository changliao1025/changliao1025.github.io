<p>Both gage height and discharge rate are important factors in surface water hydrology.<br />
For most of the time they are closely coupled.<br />
When one of them is missing, we can always estimate the other using some relation algorithms.<br />
To date, there a few commonly used relation algorithms. For example:<br />

<p>Based on these relations, a simple test was run to illustrate and estimate the discharge based on gage height.</p>
