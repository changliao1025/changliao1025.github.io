<p>I have written a couple of articles regarding the potential issues during raster operations. Here I have put down some typical workflow for these operations.<br />
For study area smaller than one MODIS granule, following these steps:</p>

<p>The common method that will work for you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Convert one HDF file to GeoTIFF using ArcMap, save this file as A.tif.</li>
  <li>Convert all HDF files to GeoTIFF using IDL and A.tif, call routine “hdf2tiff”. In this step, you should set all unwanted pixel to missing value, such as -9999.</li>
  <li>Project one GeoTIFF A.tif to B.dat using ArcMap;</li>
  <li>Project all GeoTIFF to ENVI files using B.dat, call routine “project48”;</li>
  <li>Define the missing value for all the ENVI files from step 4, call routine “define_envi_missing_value”;</li>
  <li>Prepare the shapefile mask for the study area, C.shp using Arcmap, C should has the same projection as the target projection;</li>
  <li>Extract all ENVI files using the C.shp shapefile , call routine “extract50”.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>(Updated January 15 2017). </em></p>

<p><em>Since in some cases it is impossible to re-project a raster from one projection to another using common projection method, which mean the above step 4 is going to fail unless you use rigorous projection method. __At the same time, rigorous method takes a long time to run. Therefore, we recommend an extraction before projection (<a href="https://github.com/changliao1025/eslib/issues/2">more details</a>). And the new steps are:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Convert one HDF file to GeoTIFF using ArcMap, save this file as A.tif.</li>
  <li>Convert all HDF files to GeoTIFF using IDL and A.tif, call routine “hdf2tiff”. In this step, you should set all unwanted pixel to missing value, such as -9999.</li>
  <li>Prepare a rectangle shapefile B.shp which covers your study domain using ArcMap. B.shp has the same spatial reference with A.tif;</li>
  <li>Extract all the GeoTIFF files using the rectangle shapefile B.shp.</li>
  <li>Define the missing value for all the ENVI files from step 4;</li>
  <li>Extract the A.tif using B.shp and save it as C.dat;</li>
  <li>Project C.dat to D.dat with the target spatial reference using ArcMap;</li>
  <li>Project all ENVI files from step 4 using D.dat, call routine “project48”;</li>
  <li>Prepare the shapefile mask for the study area, E.shp, E should has the same projection as the target projection;</li>
  <li>Extract all ENVI files from step 8 using the E.shp shapefile.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck.</p>
