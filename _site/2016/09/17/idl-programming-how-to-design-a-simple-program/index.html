<p>For scientists and engineers, our scripts/programs are usually very straightforward and simple. Even some of us are modelers, our models should be complex but the source code are still manageable.<br />
However, the re-usability of these simple programs are still necessary because a lot of our work must be done over and over again. For example, we need to plot/map some data in various scenarios. And we wants the plot/map program can be used for various types of inputs.</p>

<p>Specially, for IDL programming, there are a few common blocks that should be considered in a program.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compiler option; this step is usually just for compiling setup, you can also specify it the start-up file.</li>
  <li>Error control; some of the most important error information;</li>
  <li>Global variable; this step should be used to define the global variable, such as the extension of a file.</li>
  <li>Keyword check;</li>
  <li>Local variable; this step should be project variable, such as data range.</li>
  <li>Workspace; workspace usually refer to the directory all operations will be performance on.</li>
  <li>Main: do the actual job.</li>
  <li>Post; this is used to finish the program;Â </li>
  <li>Cleanup; mainly for memory cleanup, (optional)</li>
</ol>

<p>Another important tip is that do NOT try to finish everything within one program, especially for computationally intensive jobs.</p>

<p>I will provide an example soon.</p>
