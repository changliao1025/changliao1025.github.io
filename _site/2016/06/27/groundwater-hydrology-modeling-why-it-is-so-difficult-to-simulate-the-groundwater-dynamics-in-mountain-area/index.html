<p>First, in mountain area, there is generally less groundwater observations, which makes itâ€™s difficult to define the boundary condition. Without observations, the initial head can only be assumed or estimated using a steady state simulation.<br />
Second, groundwater recharge in mountain area is very low. This is because some mountain surface has no soil or a shallow soil layer. And the permeability of rock fractures is very low. As a result, infiltration from the surface/subsurface to groundwater systems is extremely low.<br />
Third, the hydraulic priorities of the fractured and unfractured rock material are also very low, which means the groundwater system is very sensitive.<br />
Beside, topography effects from mountain area usually require high spatial resolution grid cell in the numerical simulation.</p>
