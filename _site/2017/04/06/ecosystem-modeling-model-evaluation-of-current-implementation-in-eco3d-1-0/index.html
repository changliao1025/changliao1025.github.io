<p>As I am preparing my defense, the first version of ECOSYSTEM 1.0 in my thesis was finally completed. Looking forward to the next chapter of my life, I thought it is time to evaluate the ECOSYSTEM 1.0 to see what it is capable of and what still needs to be improved or expanded in the near future.</p>

<p>First, here is a brief introduction of the ECOSYSTEM model:<br />
ECOSYSTEM is a three-dimensional water and carbon cycle terrestrial ecosystem model. Within ECOSYSTEM model, water and carbon cycle are seamlessly coupled. The water cycle is developed based on the <a href="https://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/SW_MoWS/PRMS.html">PRMS</a>, and the carbon cycle is developed based on <a href="http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/TEM/">TEM</a>. The core idea behind the coupling is that both water and carbon (potentially nitrogen and others) fluxes can flow in a three-dimensional domain, and that is exactly one of the reasons why dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can be observed in stream water.</p>

<p>A lot of improvements have been made upon the original PRMS and TEM models. For example, I have added a new litter pool to consider the carbon pool, DOC leaching from the litter.</p>

<p>Even though model calibration of such kind of watershed hydrology-alike ecosystem model takes much effort, my initial model evaluation based on stream discharge, snow cover, GPP/NPP and DOC has shown that the three-dimensional approach have great potential. A good example could be something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian_zone">Riparian zone</a>. I am also observing significant differences in soil moisture due to lateral water flow.</p>

<p>The ECOSYSTEM model is completely developed using C++11 with OpenMP enabled. A preview of the model <a href="http://www.changliao.us/2016/05/ecosystem-modeling-000.html">structure</a>was introduced in one of my early posts. One of the advantages of using C++ is that it’s relatively easy to manage based on model structure, especially for models with sophisticated data I/O and flow.</p>

<p>Moreover, when I designed the ECOSYSTEM, a plugin approach/concept is used, which means that new processes can be easily added following the structure. This is also the same concept used in <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/ogw/modflow/">MODFLOW</a>and PRMS.</p>

<p>With ECOSYSTEM, we can answer quite a few questions, including but not limited to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How is surface hydrology responding to climate?</li>
  <li>How is surface hydrology responding to land-use and land-cover change (e.g., wildfire)?</li>
  <li>What is the role of lateral flow in soil moisture?</li>
  <li>What is the role of lateral flow in carbon cycle?</li>
  <li>What about DOC dynamics?</li>
</ol>

<p>However, due to the time constrain, I haven’t implemented some other important processes into the ECOSYSTEM model currently. And potentially I will keep working on this project and finish a newer version when time is right.</p>

<p>Here are a few processes that need to be added or improved in future development:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Groundwater flow is currently improved but not as good as MODFLOW, but it may be unnecessary to actually implement MODFLOW within ECOSYSTEM;</li>
  <li>Soil water has different types of reservoirs, but the concept of layered model may improve vertical profile, which is also important for thermal process;</li>
  <li>Soil thermal is currently simplified, it could be coupled with soil water using algorithm from TEM or other similar model such as <a href="http://permafrost.gi.alaska.edu/content/modeling">GIPL</a>;</li>
  <li>Three-dimensional heat transport is missing, but with soil thermal (or even groundwater flow), it could be implemented;</li>
  <li>Snow model currently does not consider heat from soil. A better layered snow model such as <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/snowpack">Snowpack</a>can replace the current one;</li>
  <li>A dynamical stream network may be added, which means the hydrology networks vary with  time;</li>
  <li>Carbon and nitrogen coupling;</li>
  <li>Thermokarst lake modeling is missing;</li>
  <li>With thermal and soil carbon module, a new permafrost carbon release module could be implemented.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully, the last list will be shorted or even gone within one year.</p>
