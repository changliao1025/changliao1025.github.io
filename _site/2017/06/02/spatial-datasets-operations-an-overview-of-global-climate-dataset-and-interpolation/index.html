<p>Climate dataset is literally the most important data in climate change research. Great efforts have been made to prepare climate dataset over the decades.</p>

<p>In my recent project, I need to prepare some climate dataset at global scale. Then I have to take some time to finish a review of current state of climate dataset at global scale.</p>

<p>First, I want to emphasize “global scale” including both arctic and antarctic. Because I will use this data in a three-dimensional ecosystem simulation, a special configuration of the data structure will be used, which is completely different from traditional approaches.</p>

<p>Second, where or how can we get the climate data?</p>

<p>The easiest source we can turn to is existing global climate dataset, such as CRU dataset, NCEP dataset. I try not to get into details of these data but rather list the source and state some critical aspects that we have to take into consideration.</p>

<p>CRU:<br />

NCEP:<br />

WorldClim<br />

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to use</li>
  <li>Global coverage</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Missing polar regions</li>
  <li>Coarse resolution</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on meteorology site observations, many spatial interpolation methods can also be used to produce spatial dataset.<br />

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to implement</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data not well distributed</li>
  <li>Algorithm uncertainty</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also advanced tools can be used to prepare climate data.<br />

PRISM<br />
<a href="http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/">http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/</a></p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Could potential on global scale</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Computational demand</li>
  <li>Hard to implement </li>
</ul>

<p>Recently, Artificial Neural Network has also been used for spatial interpolation. But current tests show that ANN may not be as good as traditional approaches.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to use</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Uncertainty</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to highlight that our use of latitude/longitude in spatial resolution will cause issues in polar regions. This is because of the underlying mathematics definition of latitude/longitude. There are a few solutions to this issue but that is currently out of the scope in this post. I will provide some hint here that may be used to address this issue.<br />

<p>So what could potentially be the best choice?<br />
As for now, I see the potential in ANN since it is nonlinear and could potentially performance well compared with traditional approaches. </p>
