<p>Numerical hydrology models usually require the stream index to be built prior to the actual simulation.<br />
It is also good practice to keep them in order so it is much easier to analyse the results.</p>

<p>Here I have provided an examples how it could be done using some scripts and <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis">ArcMap</a>.<br />
After the drainage line is defined from watershed delineation process such as using <a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/en/communities/hydro/01vn0000000s000000.htm">Arc Hydro tool</a>.<br />
The resulting attribute table will be like this:</p>

<p>First, it is good practice to make a copy of the file. Then we need to “<a href="http://help.arcgis.com/EN/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//00170000004n000000">Delete</a>” unwanted fields and only keep the HydroID, GridID and NextdownID fields.</p>

<p>Then export the attribute table into a text file and run the IDL routine “restore_drainageline_spatial_relationship”, which will produce a new index for each stream segment.</p>

<p>You can copy the created text file content into the Microsoft Excel for next step.</p>

<p>Then edit the drainage shapefile feature and replace the HydroID and NextdownID fields using the just copied indices in the Excel.</p>

<p>After this, the spatial relationship is restored but not sorted in the attribute table. We can use the “<a href="http://help.arcgis.com/EN/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//001700000057000000">Sort</a>” tool is sort them using HydroID field. </p>

<p>The final attribute table will be like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://changliao.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/55b7a-sort_table.png"><img src="/assets/55b7a-sort_table.png?w=223" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Well done! This attribute table is ready for other operations.</p>
