<p>Litter decomposition involves series of processes.</p>

<p>Hydrological control nearly occurs throughout the whole decomposition process. 
As a result, if there is water-soluble materials in the litter, the leaching 
will take them out.</p>

<p>The water-soluble materials include Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC).</p>

<p>Also some particulate materials (Particulate Organic Carbon (POC), etc.) may 
leach out.</p>
