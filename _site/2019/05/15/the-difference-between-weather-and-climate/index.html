<p>You may have read papers about this topics. You may also have some ideas about it as well.</p>

<p>But I will give another example here, which was inspired by the NBA draft lottery tonight.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Weather is something we can not predict well enough. Usually we are only confident about weather prediction within a few days. We cannot predict well because they are day-night, topography, and countless factors. We cannot calculate all the energy terms in the system.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>It is the same for lottery. We can not predict who is going to win it. We only know some team has a higher chance than the others.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Climate, on the other hand, is the mainstream regardless of weather. It is going to be warmer and warmer because the overall energy budget can be estimated.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Same for lottery. We are sure someone is going to win it even though we don’t know who.</p>

<p>Another example is the food in your fridge. You have lots of food. You know what you will eat tomorrow but you don’t know what you are going to eat next week. But, if you look closer, you can have a general idea whether you are going to gain or lose weight. This is because the energy in all food can be easily calculated and the approximate calories you will burn is also likely stable.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>So if you think climate will not change is like you wish no one is going to win the lottery. Or you wish you can remain healthy if you continue to eat-at-will.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Yes, the longer you waited, the more likely the lottery will be drawn and the more weight you will put on. Till then, it might be too late.</p>
