<p>Having a visual class dependency map could significantly help you to better 
understand the structure of a complex ecosystem model. For example, a group in 
University of Tennessee published a web-based <a href="http://web.ornl.gov/~7xw/CLM_Overview.html">structure 
tree</a> of the Community Land Model.</p>

<p>From the perspective of model development, a dependency map also increase your 
productivity and performance.</p>

<p>There are many approach to produce such a map. For example, if you are using 
Visual Studio IDE in Windows environment, you can try the built-in 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd409453.aspx">Architecture</a><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd409453.aspx"> 
</a>tool. And it will 
generate beautiful maps.</p>

<p>If you prefer to use open source alternatives, you can try 
<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a>. It may be already installed 
in many Linux distributions. You can also use the Window version.</p>

<p>Below is an example my current ecosystem model structure:</p>

<p>Doxygen also has lots of other features you can try out.</p>
