<p>This is a live example from the project I am working right now. Good luck if 
you are following! 
In order to speed my Anusplin program, I decided to use OpenMP. 
<a href="http://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/research/products/anusplin-vrsn-44">Anusplin</a> 
is a package for climate data preparation.</p>

<p>My program was written in C++ as usual. C++ itself is fast, but Anusplin 
program takes a long time to run for approximately 50K+ simulations. 
Previously I set up some system pause (0.1second) between each run. Let’s see 
what OpenMP can do.</p>

<p>There are many guide of OpenMP online. 
First you need to know what’s the GCC version you get, such as 
///=========================================== 
<span style="font-size: x-small;">gcc -v 
<span style="font-size: x-small;">Using built-in specs. 
<span style="font-size: x-small;">COLLECT_GCC=gcc 
<span style="font-size:  x-small;">COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/apps/rhel6/gcc/5.2.0/libexec/gcc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/5.2.0/lto-wrapper 
<span style="font-size: x-small;">Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu 
<span style="font-size: x-small;">Configured with: 
/tmp/aai/gcc-5.2.0/configure –prefix=/apps/rhel6/gcc/5.2.0 
–enable-languages=c,c++,fortran –enable-shared –enable-threads=posix 
–disable-checking –disable-multilib –with-system-zlib –enable-__cxa_atexit 
–disable-libunwind-exceptions –enable-java-awt=gtk 
–with-gmp=/apps/rhel6/gcc/5.2.0/gmp-6.1.0 
–with-mpfr=/apps/rhel6/gcc/5.2.0/mpfr-3.1.3 
–with-mpc=/apps/rhel6/gcc/5.2.0/mpc-1.0.3 
<span style="font-size: x-small;">Thread model: posix 
<span style="font-size: x-small;">gcc version 5.2.0 (GCC) 
///=========================================== 
Usually the higher, the better, but you may need to double check. 
Then here is the OpenMP version support in different versions of GCC. 
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/openmp">https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/openmp</a></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Next, I will follow this <a href="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/story/howto/openmp/">guide</a> if 
possible: 
First, I need to enable OpenMP compiler flag in my makefile as: (remember to 
backup the makefile if you want)</p>
<h2 id="g-tmpcpp--fopenmp">g++ tmp.cpp -fopenmp</h2>
<pre style="background-color: white;"></pre>
<p>Then I added the simplest control 
to my for loop:</p>
<div>**#pragma omp parallel for**<div><b> 
</b><div>Save the source code and re-compile.<div>My first error:<div>invalid 
exit from OpenMP structured block.<div>My second error:<div>undefined 
reference to `GOMP_parallel_start 
(You need to link with -fopenmp. Your makefile doesn't provide that flag on 
the linker step. Just add -fopenmp to your LDFLAGS)<div>After fixing these two 
errors within one minute, the re-compile was successful.<div> 
However, there is an error thrown out as: 
## * glibc detected * ./anusplin_openmp: double free or corruption (fasttop): 
0x00002b8144000af0 *** 

So after some research, I have set a few variables as private in the OpenMP 
and everything works now. 

By the way, if you have troubles with memory issues brought out by OpenMP, you 
can try [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html).
