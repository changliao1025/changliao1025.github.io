<p>Recently I started a series to discuss my own publications. The problem is I 
only have limited publications.</p>

<p>So I decided to start a new series: paper discussion of othersâ€™ publications.</p>

<p>At PNNL, I have co-chaired the YSPD for one year and received lots of 
feedbacks on paper discussions. I think it might help other researchers as 
well.</p>

<p>Here are some guidelines:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I will only provide comments on papers I was not a reviewer so it in 
unofficial and not credential.</li>
  <li>I will be straightforward if possible.</li>
  <li>I may also comments on models and method.</li>
</ol>
<div>Thank you.
