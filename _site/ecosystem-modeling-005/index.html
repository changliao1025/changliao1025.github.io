<p>We all agree that lateral flow is important in hydrology, but why most 
ecosystem models do not consider lateral flow?</p>

<p>The answer is usually related to spatial resolution. In a large scale or 
global scale GCM model simulation, the spatial resolution is usually 
$0.5^{\circ} \times 0.5^{\circ}$. At this resolution, lateral flow is usually 
negligible compared with vertical fluxes.</p>

<p>However, this procedure usually causes problems in mass balance. First, 
without lateral flow, freshwater into the ocean cannot be estimated 
accurately. Second, dissolved nutrients into the oceanic systems cannot be 
estimated.</p>

<p>So the question is at what resolution do we actually MUST consider lateral 
flow?</p>

<p>The answer depends on the fluxes you are looking into. For example, if you are 
looking into water flow, it it more than likely you have to always consider 
it, especially at regional scale. If you are looking into carbon/nitrogen 
fluxes, the problem will become slightly complicated.</p>

<p>First, we will need to evaluate what lateral fluxes are expressed in 
equations. 
For water flow in a simplified grid cell:</p>

<p>$ 
\begin{align}\frac{\partial Water}{\partial t} &amp; = Rain + Snowmelt  - 
Evaportranspiration \ 
&amp; + Groundwater_{upwelling} - Groundwater_{recharge} \ 
&amp; + Runoff_{in} - Runoff_{out} 
\end{align} 
$</p>

<p>For carbon fluxes:</p>

<p>$ 
\begin{align}\frac{\partial C_{pool}}{\partial t} &amp; = Photosynthesis\ 
&amp; - Resipiration_{autotrophic}  -  Resipiration_{heterotrophic} \ 
&amp; +  Carbon_{in} - Carbon_{out} 
\end{align} 
$</p>

<p>Due to the fact that terms on the right hand side are often associated with 
water condition, it is therefore difficult to determine how sensitive these 
processes are affected by lateral flow. For example, if photosynthesis 
algorithm is based on soil moisture, it is likely Photosynthesis maybe 
affected by lateral flow, but the uncertainty range could be within $5\%$ or 
more. Or dissolved carbon that flows through water flow is about $1\%$ of the 
other terms.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is our responsibility to check how sensitive our 
models/algorithms are to the lateral flow. So far, I have not seen much work 
conducted in this direction. I am planning to conduct some research using my 
three-dimensional ecosystem modeling.</p>
