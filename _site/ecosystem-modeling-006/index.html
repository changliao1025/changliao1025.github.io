<p>As I am preparing my defense, the first version of ECOSYSTEM 1.0 in my thesis 
was finally completed. Looking forward to the next chapter of my life, I 
thought it is time to evaluate the ECOSYSTEM 1.0 to see what it is capable of 
and what still needs to be improved or expanded in the near future.</p>

<p>First, here is a brief introduction of the ECOSYSTEM model: 
ECOSYSTEM is a three-dimensional water and carbon cycle terrestrial ecosystem 
model. Within ECOSYSTEM model, water and carbon cycle are seamlessly coupled. 
The water cycle is developed based on the 
<a href="https://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/SW_MoWS/PRMS.html">PRMS</a>, and the carbon 
cycle is developed based on <a href="http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/TEM/">TEM</a>. The core 
idea behind the coupling is that both water and carbon (potentially nitrogen 
and others) fluxes can flow in a three-dimensional domain, and that is exactly 
one of the reasons why dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can be observed in 
stream water.</p>

<p>A lot of improvements have been made upon the original PRMS and TEM models. 
For example, I have added a new litter pool to consider the carbon pool, DOC 
leaching from the litter.</p>

<p>Even though model calibration of such kind of watershed hydrology-alike 
ecosystem model takes much effort, my initial model evaluation based on stream 
discharge, snow cover, GPP/NPP and DOC has shown that the three-dimensional 
approach have great potential. A good example could be something like the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian_zone">Riparian zone</a>. I am also 
observing significant differences in soil moisture due to lateral water flow.</p>

<p>The ECOSYSTEM model is completely developed using C++11 with OpenMP enabled. A 
preview of the model <a href="http://www.changliao.us/2016/05/ecosystem-modeling-000.html">structure 
</a>was introduced 
in one of my early posts. One of the advantages of using C++ is that itâ€™s 
relatively easy to manage based on model structure, especially for models with 
sophisticated data I/O and flow.</p>

<p>Moreover, when I designed the ECOSYSTEM, a plugin approach/concept is used, 
which means that new processes can be easily added following the structure. 
This is also the same concept used in <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/ogw/modflow/">MODFLOW 
</a>and PRMS.</p>

<p>With ECOSYSTEM, we can answer quite a few questions, including but not limited 
to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How is surface hydrology responding to climate?</li>
  <li>How is surface hydrology responding to land-use and land-cover change 
(e.g., wildfire)?</li>
  <li>What is the role of lateral flow in soil moisture?</li>
  <li>What is the role of lateral flow in carbon cycle?</li>
  <li>What about DOC dynamics?</li>
</ol>
<div>However, due to the time constrain, I haven't implemented some other 
important processes into the ECOSYSTEM model currently. And potentially I will 
keep working on this project and finish a newer version when time is 
right.<div> 
<div>Here are a few processes that need to be added or improved in future 
development:<div>1. Groundwater flow is currently improved but not as good as 
MODFLOW, but it may be unnecessary to actually implement MODFLOW within 
ECOSYSTEM; 
1. Soil water has different types of reservoirs, but the concept of layered 
model may improve vertical profile, which is also important for thermal 
process; 
1. Soil thermal is currently simplified, it could be coupled with soil water 
using algorithm from TEM or other similar model such as 
[GIPL](http://permafrost.gi.alaska.edu/content/modeling); 
1. Three-dimensional heat transport is missing, but with soil thermal (or even 
groundwater flow), it could be implemented; 
1. Snow model currently does not consider heat from soil. A better layered 
snow model such as [Snowpack ](https://www.openhub.net/p/snowpack)can replace 
the current one; 
1. A dynamical stream network may be added, which means the hydrology networks 
vary with  time; 
1. Carbon and nitrogen coupling; 
1. Thermokarst lake modeling is missing; 
1. With thermal and soil carbon module, a new permafrost carbon release module 
could be implemented. 
<div>Hopefully, the last list will be shorted or even gone within one year.
