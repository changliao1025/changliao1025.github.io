<p>Climate dataset is literally the most important data in climate change 
research. Great efforts have been made to prepare climate dataset over the 
decades.</p>

<p>In my recent project, I need to prepare some climate dataset at global scale. 
Then I have to take some time to finish a review of current state of climate 
dataset at global scale.</p>

<p>First, I want to emphasize “global scale” including both arctic and antarctic. 
Because I will use this data in a three-dimensional ecosystem simulation, a 
special configuration of the data structure will be used, which is completely 
different from traditional approaches.</p>

<p>Second, where or how can we get the climate data?</p>

<p>The easiest source we can turn to is existing global climate dataset, such as 
CRU dataset, NCEP dataset. I try not to get into details of these data but 
rather list the source and state some critical aspects that we have to take 
into consideration.</p>

<p>CRU:

<p>Pros:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Easy to use</li>
  <li>Global coverage</li>
</ol>

<p>Cons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Missing polar regions</li>
  <li>Coarse resolution</li>
</ol>

<p>Based on meteorology site observations, many spatial interpolation methods can 
also be used to produce spatial dataset.

<div>Cons:<div>1. Computational demand 
1. Hard to implement 
<div> 
Recently, Artificial Neural Network has also been used for spatial 
interpolation. But current tests show that ANN may not be as good as 
traditional approaches. 

Pros: 
1. Easy to use 

<div>Cons:<div>1. Uncertainty 
<div> 
<div>I want to highlight that our use of latitude/longitude in spatial 
resolution will cause issues in polar regions. This is because of the 
underlying mathematics definition of latitude/longitude. There are a few 
solutions to this issue but that is currently out of the scope in this post. I 
will provide some hint here that may be used to address this issue.

So what could potentially be the best choice? 
As for now, I see the potential in ANN since it is nonlinear and could 
potentially performance well compared with traditional approaches.
