<p>In the hydrological cycle, ocean water has the largest storage without doubt. 
However, our estimates of the ocean water storage have great uncertainty.  I 
have done some preliminary research into this field and I’d like to share my 
understanding of the current state of these estimates. I also post a related 
question in the ReseachGate website 
(<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/Global_water_budget_uncertainty">Link</a>).<br />
I will start with a few publications and reports. The first one is the USGS 
website: 
<a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html">https://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html</a>, 
which states the ocean storage to be around 96.5% of the global storage. The 
numbers are from “World fresh water resources” by Peter H Gleick 1993.</p>
