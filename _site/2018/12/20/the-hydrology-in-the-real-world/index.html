<p>Below is a region of interest from Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (<a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/global-lakes-and-wetlands-database">link</a>).</p>

<p>My question is how can we represent them in the Earth System Model?</p>

<p>To understand the challenge, we need to know how hydrology features are represented in current modeling work.</p>

<p>In an ideal scenario when there is no lake, stream network are the dominant hydrology features.</p>

<p>To date, most existing hydrology simulations are conducted at relatively large spatial domain. As a result, the spatial resolution of such simulation is limited to hundred to thousand of meters. Sometimes it is impossible to capture some features under this resolution.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the land is never homogeneous and lots of local depressions are visible. These local depressions are removed in most hydrological model.</p>

<p>When there are lakes, the situation gets complicated. There are several challenges we will face:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A lake may changed its boundary depending on water storage;</li>
  <li>A lake may or may not have an outlet;</li>
  <li>A lake itself is a local depression, so should we remove it or not?</li>
</ol>

<p>I will provide more details in the near future how we can consider lake in a Earth System Model.</p>
