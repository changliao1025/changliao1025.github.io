<p>Earlier I have discussed some <strong><a href="https://www.changliao.us/2017/06/spatial-datasets-operations-006.html">idea</a></strong> about the hexagon-based grid system. Now I have provided some tests and materials to support this project.</p>

<p>90% percent of global maps you can find online are using the geographic coordinate system (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system">GCS</a>). You can try to search “global map” in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1277&amp;bih=688&amp;ei=WkhvW8qKJ4TesAW915yAAw&amp;q=global+map&amp;oq=global+&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.35i39k1j0l9.1747.2687.0.4513.9.9.0.0.0.0.127.697.0j6.6.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..3.6.696.0...0.NzMugjEpFdI">Google image</a>.</p>

<p>There might be 9% of them are using various map projection.</p>

<p>The reason why there are so many different ways to represent the Earth is that Earth is NOT flat. Google know it so they changed the Google Map recently.</p>

<p>So these are some basic GIS knowledge but you can also learn it from this video.</p>

<p>While it is generally OK to view these types of global map for daily usage, it can cause problems for large scale to global scale simulations.</p>

<p>In Earth science, GCS is most commonly used as the grid system for terrestrial ecosystem simulations. For example, a 1* 1 degree grid will discrete the global into a 360 * 180 matrix.</p>

<p>However, it will be problematic for several reasons.<br />
For example, the area at different regions are not the same. For example. a 0.5* 0.5 grid cell is about 50*50km in Amazon whereas it is about 50*25km in Alaska, only half the size of the former one.</p>

<p>To illustrate the difference, let’s use a classical 2D heat equation I found from <a href="https://scipython.com/book/chapter-7-matplotlib/examples/the-two-dimensional-diffusion-equation/">here</a>:<br />
First, we run the simulation with the uniformly dx = dy, which present longitude and latitude in our case. The results are like this:</p>

<p>Then we changed to dy = 2 dx: </p>

<p>Last, we changed to dx = 2 dy:</p>

<p><a href="https://changliao.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/f9536-figure_3.png"><img src="/assets/f9536-figure_3.png?w=300" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>If you look closer, you will see the differences. When the grid geometry is not uniform, the simulated heat distribution is also not uniform in spatial.</p>

<p>Now let’s get back to GCS in global simulation. Because the grid geometry changes from tropic to pole regions, the simulations are likely affected as well.</p>

<p>Next, I will show you some results of global scale hydrologic simulation.</p>
