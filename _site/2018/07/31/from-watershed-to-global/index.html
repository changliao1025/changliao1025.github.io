<p>Ever since I finished my 3D ecosystem simulation using the ECO3D model, I started to think about applying this model to a larger spatial domain such as global.</p>

<p>While there are several technical difficulties in doing so, there are also different combinations of solutions to resolve these issues. In this post I will list out major issues we will address:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, on a global scale, we need much more massive input data preparation. Whatâ€™s more, some traditional algorithm/method may not even work. For example, the watershed lineation process on global scale will not be used anymore. Instead, another river routing algorithm or dataset should be used.</li>
  <li>File I/O will becomes an issue. Global scale simulation will use parallel computing, which mean the file I/O must support parallel reading/writing. Whether file system will be ideal or other options remains unclear. For example, can we use database or Hadoop?</li>
  <li>Parallel computing with/without MPI/OpenMP. I am not sure of other options but running billion of instances on HPC requires parallel computing for sure. Maybe Hadoop or GPU could help.</li>
  <li>Global grid system must be updated. Can we have a uniform grid scheme for simulation? With spatial relationship established, interactions among grids can be easier considered.</li>
  <li>File storage. If data are not stored in database alike data server. A better storage approach will be used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the ECO3D is finally released, my next research focus will be applying it to a large spatial domain. The following steps should be taken in sequence:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add MPI capability to the ECO3D model. Currently it only uses OpenMP for a watershed scale. On a global scale, MPI is an inevitable path;</li>
  <li>Develop the DGGS for the spatial discretization scheme;</li>
  <li>Design a better storage system for file I/O.</li>
  <li>Develop a GDAL-based raster/vector dataset tool, this tool will be used to speed up all geospatial dataset operations.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am also looking forward to working with collaborators.</p>
