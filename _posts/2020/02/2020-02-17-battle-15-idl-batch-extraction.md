I was using my own library to extract geotiff with shapefile, then the program 
stops after day 9. 

I restarted from day 9, it continues to run another 9 day. 

Initially I thought I didnâ€™t release the file handle and reached the limit. 
It was not because I destroyed everything at each loop. 

Finally I realized that I changed the structure of the batch mode. 
So I moved batch command outside and everything work again!
