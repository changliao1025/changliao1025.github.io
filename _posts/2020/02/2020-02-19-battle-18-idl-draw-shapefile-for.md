The HexWatershed model assumes that the spatial references of the DEM and 
Hexagon grid are the same. 
In reality, there are often not. 

So there are two options: convert DEM to Grid or convert Grid to DEM. 

Because the current grid was generated by QGIS, its projection is not ideal 
for some area. 
For the best visualization, it is better to convert grid.
